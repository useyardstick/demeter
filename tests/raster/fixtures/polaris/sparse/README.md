Sparse POLARIS fixtures
=======================

This directory contains GeoTIFF raster images from POLARIS, with the data
values zeroed out to keep file sizes small. Even zeroed out, these files are
valid GeoTIFF containing real GIS metadata, so they are still useful for
testing. You probably won't be able to open them in an image viewer though,
because they are
[sparse](https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/gtiff.html#sparse-files).
